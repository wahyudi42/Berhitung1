##Berhitung

Berhitung is an app that teach user 5 things about mathematical calculations. That 5 things are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and arithmetic operations. Berhitung have two main features, materials and training. In the materials menu, Berhitung provide materials that can be read by user, so user can understand how to calculate the number in math. In the training menu, Berhitung provide a quiz to train users in math, so users more familiar with mathematical calculations. The quiz isn’t hard but not too easy and it can be randomize, so user can train their self with a tons of math quizzes.

##Target User

The target user is anyone who want learn about mathematical calculations, especially for Indonesian people. Berhitung app is built in one language that is Indonesian. I hope with this app, Indonesian people can use this app to teach math to their self or their friends. I choose this app idea, because mathematical app that’s already in the playstore didn’t provide mathematical materials, only quizzes. With this app users not only know how to calculate but they will know the knowledge in mathematical calculations.

##Version

This is the first version of Berhitung app
